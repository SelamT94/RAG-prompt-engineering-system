# System Architecture

## Overview
The system is designed to automatically generate, evaluate, and rank prompts for Language Models (LLMs). It incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance prompt generation and includes a robust evaluation framework.

## Components
1. **Prompt Generation**: Generates prompts based on user input.
2. **RAG Integration**: Fetches relevant data to improve prompt accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: Assesses prompts using various metrics and ranking systems.
4. **User Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input data and view results.

## Data Flow
1. User inputs description and scenarios.
2. System generates prompts using the prompt generation module.
3. RAG integration enhances prompts with relevant data.
4. Prompts are evaluated and ranked.
5. Results are displayed to the user.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Flask (for UI)
- Various ML/NLP libraries
